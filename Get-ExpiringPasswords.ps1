.Synopsis
    Get-ExpiringPasswords is a cmdlet created to alert users if they have a password expiring in the next 14 days or less.
    It was made to run on Task Scheudler. I suggest having it run once every 2 or 3 days on a domain controller.

.DESCRIPTION
    This cmdlet Get-ExpiringPasswords finds users who have passwords expiring in 14 days or less and sends them an email.
    Your email body should be edited to explain to users how to change their passwords in different situations if they exist.
